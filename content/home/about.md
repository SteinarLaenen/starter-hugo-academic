Currently I am a PhD student in Theoretical Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh, where I'm fortunate to be supervised by [Dr. He Sun](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hsun4/). My research interests are spectral graph theory, graph clustering algorithms, and unsupervised learning.

Before that I was a research intern at [Five](http://www.five.ai) in the Oxford research group, which has close ties with the Torr Vision group at Oxford University. I worked on few-shot learning together with [Dr. Luca Bertinetto](http://research.gxstudios.net/)

I received my MSc in Artificial Intelligence graduate (with distinction) from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees?id=107&r=site/view). For my thesis I received the Joint AI MSc Dissertation Prize, awarded to 2 out of 200+ students.
