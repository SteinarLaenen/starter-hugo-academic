title: Organisor of a talk series on societal impact of AI development
summary: At Edinburgh University I was heavily involved in initiating and organising a series of panel discussions titled We Need to Talk About AI, where we invited insightful speakers to discuss some pressing societal issues around AI development. I was involved in three events which related to Data & Privacy, the Future of Work and Autonomous Weapons. Due to the succes of the talk series it is now officially funded and endorsed by the Edinburgh Futures Institute.
