title: Research Team co-lead at EUFS
summary: While doing my AI MSc at the University of Edinburgh, I was part of the autonomous driving team at Edinburgh University Forumula Student , where I co-led the research team. We implemented a deep ConvNet to drive the car autonomously in ROS simulation using supervised learning, and we implemented an end-to-end controller that learns to drive a car from scratch using Deep Reinforcement Learning.
