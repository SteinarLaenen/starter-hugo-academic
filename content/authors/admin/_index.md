I am a first year PhD student at the [Laboratory for Foundations in Computer
      Science](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfcs), in the [School of
      Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) at the University of Edinburgh. I am supervised by [Dr. He Sun](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hsun4/).

Before that I was a research intern at [Five](http://www.five.ai), in their Oxford research
group, where I worked on few-shot learning together with [Dr. Luca Bertinetto](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~luca/)

I received my MSc in Artificial Intelligence graduate (with distinction) from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees?id=107&r=site/view). For my thesis I received the Joint AI MSc Dissertation Prize, awarded to 2 out of 200+ students. I did my bachelors (summa cum laude) in mathematics and computer science at [Amsterdam University College](http://www.auc.nl/).

My current research focuses on developing (fast) clustering algorithms for
graphs, using techniques from spectral graph theory.
