I am a first year PhD student at the [Laboratory for Foundations in Computer
      Science](URL "https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfcs"), in the [School of
      Informatics](URL "https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics") at the University of
		Edinburgh. I'm fortunate to be supervised by [Dr. He Sun](URL
      "https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hsun4/").



My current research focuses on developing (fast) clustering algorithms for
graphs, using techniques from spectral graph theory.
