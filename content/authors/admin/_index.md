I am a final-year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh's [School Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics), where I am supervised by [Dr. He Sun](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hsun4/). My research focuses on developing clustering algorithms for graphs, using techniques from spectral graph theory. During my PhD I spent three months (Aug-Oct 2024) as a student researcher in Google's [Operations Research](https://research.google/teams/operations-research/) team.

Before my PhD I was a research intern at [Five](http://www.five.ai) in their Oxford research
group, where I worked on few-shot learning together with [Dr. Luca Bertinetto](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~luca/)

I received my MSc in Artificial Intelligence graduate (with distinction) from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees?id=107&r=site/view). For my thesis I received the Joint AI MSc Dissertation Prize, awarded to 2 out of 200+ students. I did my bachelors (summa cum laude) in mathematics and computer science at [Amsterdam University College](http://www.auc.nl/).
