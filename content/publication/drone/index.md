abstract: Rapid advances and developments in drone technologies have made mapping of geothermal surface manifestations doable and routine. In this study a DJI Matrice 210 drone, equipped with optical and thermal cameras, successfully maps some 1-4 km2 per day. Deliverables are  an  orthomosaic  aerial  and  digital  surface  models  (DSM)  and  a  thermal  reflectance  map  in  °C.  Data  gathered  from  relatively  low altitude flights, no more than 250 meters above ground surface, yields orthomosaic resolutions of only few centimeters/pixel and thermal resolutions of 20-30 cm. The thermal imagery is manipulated to be effectively processed to a map and ran through atmospheric corrections to  maximize  accuracy  in  °C.  In  this  paper,  thermal  maps  collected  in  four  Icelandic  locations  are  shown  to  produce  lineaments  of geothermal importance simply by ignoring all temperatures below a certain threshold. With this approach N-S oriented and a few hundred-meter-long structures in Svartsengi are inferred. The 1973 Eldfell eruption on Heimaey island in S-Iceland is still emitting heat to surface, inferring  the  thick  basaltic  lave  pile  deposited  45  years  ago  is  yet  to  be  fully  solidified.  The  Geysir  hot  spring  area  thermal  map  is confirming previously published N-S orientation of the field main upflow zone, complemented with new warm surface areas and vivid convection  cells  in  the  hot  water  bowls  of  Strokkur  and  Geysir  eruptive  hot  springs.  The  east  flanks  of  Snæfellsjökull,  a  glaciated stratovolcano, are suspected to be heated by a deep seated and currently hidden boiling geothermal reservoir, by cross correlating high elevation vegetation growth, gaps in the snow cover and gently warm grounds.
